## Introduction

To compile the compiler run `stack build` and to test `stack test`. To compile a particular program run `stack run program`. The compiled program will be saved as `a.wat`.

To filter tests that fail do `stack test | grep Error` and to filter tests that pass do `stack test | grep Success`.

## Assignment 4: Compiler

(deadlines Monday May 3 and Thursday May 13)

Copy the directory [Compiler](https://github.com/ChapmanCPSC/compiler-assignments/tree/master/Compiler) to the github repo you are using for your assignments and name it `Assignment4`.

- For the first deadline follow the intstallation instructions and do the exercise of [Lecture 12.1](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2021/blob/master/lecture-12.1.md).

- Careful testing and development will require you to write your own test programs in addition to the ones in `test/good`. Make them available in a directory named `Assignment4/mytest`. **Two points will be awarded for developing your own test suite.** See below for examples on how to do this. If you want these new tests to be tested automatically upon calling `stack test` you can modify `test/Spec.hs` accordingly.

- For the second deadline complete the template file `src/Compiler.hs`. 

To get started on the second deadline, I suggest the following.

- Change directory to `Assignment4` and run `./setup.sh` and `stack test`. You should see that no tests are passed.

*Remark:* (This remark is from 2020 and may be obsolete.) (We fixed the problem described in this remark by adding a try-catch to `test/wat2wasm.js`, but I leave it in as docker may still be useful for similar incompatibility problems that may arise in the future.) Our first version was compatible with `node` version 10 but not version 14. Jonathan Burns located this problem and fixed it by  providing a dockerfile that you can run by `docker build . -t compiler`.

**Prerequisites:**
- Convert wat to wasm and run a wasm file: [Here](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2021/blob/master/lecture-12.1.md)
- Write webassembly by hand: [Here](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2021/blob/master/lecture-12.2.md)
- see also the summary of commands below

**Workflow:** (This is only a suggestion, feel free to invent your own.) (1) Modify `Compiler.hs`. (2) Write a test program named for example `mytest.cc` (or modify one of the existing ones in `test/good`) that only contains code that is needed to test the features you are currently working on in `Compiler.hs`. (3) Run `stack build`. (4) Run `stack run mytest/mytest.cc`. (5) Check whether there is a file `a.wat`; if not go back to (1) and/or (2). (6) Inspect the file `a.wat` and make sure that the code your compilier produced agrees with the one you would write by hand. (7) Recall from [Compiling C++ to WASM](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2021/blob/master/lecture-12.1.md) how to convert `.wat` to `.wasm` and how to run a `.wasm` file. (6) Compare the output of `a.wasm` with the output of the corresponding C++ program. (7) Go back to (1) and/or (2). 

As always, we work by induction on the abstract syntax tree.

### The cases of `EInt` and `SReturn`

- The simplest test program is `test/good/return_42.cc`, displayed below.

      int main() {
        return 42;
      }

  Our first task will be to extend `Compiler.hs` so that it passes `return_42.cc`. In particular, we have to complete the definition of

      compileStm :: MonadState Env m => Stm -> m [SExp]

  and of 

      compileExp :: MonadState Env m => Nesting -> Exp -> m [SExp]

- Here, `SExp` does not refer to the eponymous rule in the grammar, but is short for S-expression. Let us have a look at the definition of `SExp` in the compiler:

      data SExp = Atom String | List [SExp] deriving Eq

  In words, an `SExp` is either a string labelled by `Atom` or a list of `SExp`s. This is the datatype that the compiler uses for Webassembly output. To see an example, find  
  
      test = s_module [
              s_import "readInt" [] s_i32,
              s_import "readDouble" [] s_f64,
              s_import "printInt" [s_i32] s_void,
              s_import "printDouble" [s_f64] s_void,
              s_func "main" [] s_i32 [
                  s_local "i" s_f64,
                  s_call "readDouble",
                  s_local_set "i",
                  s_local_get "i",
                  s_call "printDouble",
                  s_i32_const 0
              ],
              s_export "main"
          ]
  
  in the compiler and run 
  
      stack ghci
      putStrLn $ pprint test
      
  The first line brings up the Haskell REPL and the second then generates the following Webassembly program in Wat-format.

      (module
       (import "env" "readInt" (func $readInt (result i32)))
       (import "env" "readDouble" (func $readDouble (result f64)))
       (import "env" "printInt" (func $printInt (param i32)))
       (import "env" "printDouble" (func $printDouble (param f64)))
       (func
        $main
        (result i32)
        (local $i f64)
        (call $readDouble)
        (local.set $i)
        (local.get $i)
        (call $printDouble)
        (i32.const 0)
       )
       (export "main" (func $main))
      )

  If you want to see the details of how the translation from `SExp` to Webassembly (Wat, to be precise) works, find the definition of `pprint` in the compiler.

- To summarise this excursion into `SExp` think of it as an intermediate representation that provides a suitable output format for the compiler and at the same time is very close already to Wat programs.

- Let us return to the task of generating Wat-code from `return_42.cc`. 

- As we have done above for the typechecker, we use the bnfc generated parser to obtain the abstract syntax tree of `return_42.cc`. This tells us that we need to implement `EInt` in `compileExp` and `SReturn` in `compileStm`.

- Let us start with `EInt`. 
  - We need to consider that at the top level expressions do not return a result (checkout the rule `SExp` of the grammar). 
  - To deal with this, the compiler makes a distinction between `TopLevel` and `Nested` (checkout the definition of `data Nesting` in `Compiler.hs`). 
  - Finally, we need to generate code. For this we use the `s_`-functions defined at the beginning of the compiler. Each `s_`-function returns an `SExp`. Reading throug the definitions from `s_i32` to `s_f64_ne`, you will recognize the Webassembly code we have written by hand in the lectures. For example, we find there

        s_i32_const i = List [Atom "i32.const", Atom (show i)]

    which will output the Webassembly fragment `i32.const i` (with `i` replaced by its value). 
    

  - Finally, we can implement the case `SExp`
  
        compileExp n (EInt i) = return $ if n == Nested then [s_i32_const i] else []

- We continue with `SReturn`, that is we need to complete the definition of 

      compileStm (SReturn e) = do

  In this case, `e` is a nested expression. So we continue the recursion with

      compileStm (SReturn e) = do
        s_e <- compileExp Nested e

  and then return

      return $ 
        s_e ++ 
        [s_return]

  To see that this is correct recall that `++` is concatenation of lists and run (in the Haskell REPL, see above)

      putStrLn $ pprint $ List [s_i32_const 1, s_return]
  
  which indeed gives the output you would expect from your knowledge of Webassembly (see Lectures 12.1 and 12.2). Btw, if you want the output to be not just a Wat-fragment but a valid program you can write instead

      putStrLn $ pprint $ s_module [ s_func "main" [] s_i32 [ s_i32_const 1, s_return ] ]

- Use `Ctrl-d` to exit the Haskell REPL.

- Putting things together, we can now run `stack test | grep Success` on the modified `Compiler.hs` and should obtain

      Successfully compiled to Wasm: ass_in_arith.cc
      <...>
      Successfully compiled to Wasm: return_42.cc
      Successfully run: return_42.cc
      <...>
      Successfully run: void_return_empty.cc

  This was hard work, but we see that we made some progress. If you want to see the programs that fail run `stack test | grep Error`.

  Some further remarks:

  - If you just want to compile `return_42.cc` to Wat, run

        stack run test/good/return_42.cc

    which will place `a.wat` in `Compiler`.
  - The reason that many programs compile "successfully" to Wasm is that `compileStm` and `compileExp` have catch-all clauses that make the compiler ignore all constructs that are not yet implemented. Look at `redeclare_in_in.wat` to see an example of what that means. So don't take this as a sign of success without further investigation.

  - The programs that also run "successfully" have no specified output, so the fact that they pass the test does not mean automatically that they are compiled correctly. 

I would suggest you continue with arithmetic and in/de-crements as well as loop and conditional as discussed in the lectures.

### Write your own test programs

A good idea of how to develop the compiler is to add test programs that incrementally add features. Make a new folder `mytest`.
  
#### The case of `ETimes`

Let us add to `mytest` the following program which I call `easy_mult.cc`.

    int main() {
      return 2*3;
    }
    
To compile this program we need to implement the case of `ETimes`. So we add 

    compileExp n (ETimes e1 e2) = compileArith e1 e2 s_i32_mul s_f64_mul

In order to find out that this is the right thing to do you need to do the following.

- Read `compileArith` and understand (not necessarily all details, but the outlines of) what it is doing. In particular it will compile the code for `e1` and `e2`. 

- Search and find in `Compiler.hs` the functions that generate the code for muliplication. 

Now we are in the position to compile `easy_mult.cc` as follows.

    stack build
    stack run mytest/easy_mult.cc
    more a.wat

At this stage we carefully read the Webassembly program `a.wat`. Is it a correct translation of the C++ program?

We could also run `a.wat` but not much would happen as it does not have input or output.

#### The case of `EApp`

Let us add to `mytest` the following program which I call `easy_mult2.cc`.

    int main() {
      printInt(2*3);
      return 0;
    }
    
`printInt` is implemented in the template, but we need function application. We start with

    compileExp n (EApp (Id i) args) = do 
        s_args <- mapM (compileExp Nested) args

where `mapM` applies `compileExp Nested` to all elements of `args`. Then we need to push the arguments on the stack and call the function:

        return $ 
            concat s_args ++ 
            [s_call i]

Finally, there is one modification to make. If the function call is at the top level and returns something then we need to pop this result from the stack. (For more on drop see [here](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/Semantics.md).) So overall we obtain

    compileExp n x@(EApp (Id i) args) = do 
        s_args <- mapM (compileExp Nested) args
        ty <- getType x
        return $ 
            concat s_args ++ 
            [s_call i] ++
            if n == TopLevel && ty /= Type_void then [s_drop] else []

where the `x@` defines `x` as a shorthand for `(EApp (Id i) args)`. We compile now our test program

    stack build
    stack run mytest/easy_mult2.cc
    more a.wat

to obtain

    (module
     (import "env" "readInt" (func $readInt (result i32)))
     (import "env" "readDouble" (func $readDouble (result f64)))
     (import "env" "printInt" (func $printInt (param i32)))
     (import "env" "printDouble" (func $printDouble (param f64)))
     (func $main (result i32) 
        (i32.const 2) 
        (i32.const 3) 
        i32.mul 
        (call $printInt) 
        (i32.const 0) 
        return)
     (export "main" (func $main)))

which looks exactly as what we wanted: pushing 2 and 3, multiplying, printing.

Apart from validating the program by reading it, we should also run it.

    node test/wat2wasm.js a.wat
    node test/run.js a.wasm

This results in the output of `6`, as expected.

#### `EApp` revisited, the role of drop

If we want to understand better how the `drop` works we can write two new test programs that show the difference. We let `drop.cc` be

    int main() {
      f();
    }
    
    int f() {
        return 7;
    }

and `no-drop.cc` be

    int main() {
      return f();
    }
    
    int f() {
        return 7;
    }

If  you compare the corresponding compiled `wat`-programs you see that if `f` is called on the top leve a `drop` is inserted and if `f` is called nested inside an expression this does not happen.

**Additional Exercise:** For an example of what kind of error you may get without inserting `drop` follow the folowing steps.
- Compile [no-drop2.cc]().
- Check that it compiles to Wat and runs.
- Inspect `a.wat`, find `drop` and delete `drop`.
- On running the modified `a.wat` you should get the following Webassembly run-time error. 

      a.wat:7:14: error: type mismatch in function, expected [] but got [i32]
       (func $foo (call $bar))

#### TopLevel vs Nested

Find the data type `Nesting`. Its values are used to distinguish toplevel from nested expressions. 

From the point of view of C++, toplevel expressions are those whose value can be ignored. From the point of view of the C++ grammar they arise from the rule

    SExp.        Stm ::= Exp ";" ;

which corresponds in the compiler to the equation

    compileStm (SExp e) = compileExp TopLevel e

To summarise, toplevel expressions are statements the value of which can be ignored.

From the point of view of Webassembly, the distinction is important because at the end of a function, block, conditional, etc the stack must be empty. To illustrate the point let us look at 

    int main () {
    	int i;
    	if (true) {
    		++i;
    	} else {
    		i++;
    	}
    	return 0;
    }

which translates to Webassembly as follows.

    (module
     (import "env" "readInt" (func $readInt (result i32)))
     (import "env" "readDouble" (func $readDouble (result f64)))
     (import "env" "printInt" (func $printInt (param i32)))
     (import "env" "printDouble" (func $printDouble (param f64)))
     (func
      $main
      (result i32)
      (local $ii$0 i32)
      (i32.const 1)
      (if
       (then (local.get $ii$0) (i32.const 1) i32.add (local.set $ii$0))
       (else (local.get $ii$0) (local.get $ii$0) (i32.const 1) i32.add (local.set $ii$0) drop)
      )
      (i32.const 0)
      return
     )
     (export "main" (func $main))
    )

There is a lot of code to digest, so let us get through this step by step.

- Read the `then`-branch of the Wat-program. Normally, if the pre-increment is nested as eg in `++i*2`, we would use `local.tee` instead of `local.set`, since the incremented value is needed on the stack (to be multiplied by `2` eg).

    - But, in the particular case at hand, `++i` is not nested but at the toplevel. 

    - **Exercise:** Replace in the `then`-branch `local.set` by `local.tee` and observe the error message you get when you compile to wasm.

- Read the `else`-branch of the Wat-program. 

    - After `(local.set $ii$0)` what is the top value on the stack?
    
    - Normally, if the post-increment is nested as eg in `i++*2`, this is the value we want on the top of the stack in order to continue with the multiplication. But, in the particular case at hand, `i++` is not nested but at the toplevel. 

    - **Exercise**: Remove in the `else`-branch `drop` and observe the error message you get when you compile to wasm.

The point of the exercises is that you may encounter similar error messages later on, so it is good to have seen them before.
       
#### Going on with `EAss` and `SInit`

The next steps could be 

    int main() {
      int x;
      x=2;
      printInt(x*3);
      return 0;
    }
    
and
    
    int main() {
      int x = 2*3;
      printInt(x);
      return 0;
    }
